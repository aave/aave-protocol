    Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of third parties; and 

    Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation so we might ask you for additional information. 

We will promise the following: 

    We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date; 

    If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report;
